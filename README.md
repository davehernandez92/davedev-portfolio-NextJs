# Allan Banuelos Photography Website

Welcome to the readme file for this project, a website tailored for a wedding photographer based in the picturesque destination of Acapulco, Mexico. The development of this site leverages the power of Next.js, Cloudinary, CSS Modules, Tailwind CSS and Framer Motion to create a visually stunning and highly performant online presence.


## Performance-Driven Design with Next.js 


The choice of Next.js as the framework for this project stems from its exceptional performance, particularly in handling images. With server-side rendering and optimized image loading capabilities, Next.js ensures that your website not only looks stunning but also delivers a seamless user experience with fast-loading images, vital for a photography portfolio.




## Automated Email Acknowledgment:

Enhancing client communication, the website incorporates an automated email reply system. When a potential client reaches out through the contact form, they will promptly receive an acknowledgment email. This feature adds a personal touch to the user experience, assuring clients that their messages have been received and are being attended to.
